Needed to convert quite a bit between mph and min/km when running on the treadmills in the US.
Couldent find any good websites, so decided to make my own.
Also added the pounds to kg and kg to pounds, since I also use this quite a bit in the gym.
Later also added conversion between fahrenheit and celsius.
